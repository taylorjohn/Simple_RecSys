I am trying to find the 3 most similar to a name by sorting combinations of a 2 set of dummies(get_dummies) plus a column. Or find the name of the top 3 matchings (most in common) of the combinations of column data - herotype, weapons, and spells.

I made a simple data frame example using some random DnD data.

I have a data frame loaded from CSV it has the id a name, herotype, weapons, and spells.

name there is only one so its unique

herotype can only be one choice but many names can have the same herotype

weapons a name can have one or many combinations weapons

spells a name can also have one or many combinations weapons
